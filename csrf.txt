### Aman (You) and Hacker in an HDFC Bank Scenario with CSRF Attack

#### **Scenario Setup**
- **You**: Aman, logged into your HDFC Bank account (hdfc.com) on your browser.
- **Hacker**: A malicious attacker who wants to transfer money from your account to theirs.
- **Goal**: Understand how CSRF works and how the hacker exploits it.

---

### **Steps in a CSRF Attack**

#### **1. Aman Logs Into HDFC Bank**
- You log in to your bank account (`hdfc.com`) using your username and password.
- The bank sets a **session cookie** (e.g., `sessionId=123456`) in your browser. This cookie is automatically sent with every request to `hdfc.com`.

---

#### **2. Hacker Sets Up a Malicious Website**
- The hacker creates a malicious website, `hacker.com`.
- On `hacker.com`, they embed a hidden request to the bankâ€™s fund transfer endpoint:
  ```html
  <img src="https://hdfc.com/transfer?toAccount=hackerAccount&amount=100000" />
  ```
- This hidden request will automatically execute when you visit `hacker.com`.

---

#### **3. Aman Visits Hacker's Website**
- While logged into `hdfc.com`, you accidentally visit `hacker.com` (e.g., through a phishing email or a fake ad).
- The malicious website (`hacker.com`) silently triggers the hidden request:
  ```html
  <img src="https://hdfc.com/transfer?toAccount=hackerAccount&amount=100000" />
  ```

---

#### **4. Browser Automatically Sends Cookies**
- Because the request is to `hdfc.com` and you are already logged in, your browser **automatically includes the session cookie** (`sessionId=123456`) with the request.

---

#### **5. Bank Processes the Request**
- The bank sees a valid session cookie (`sessionId=123456`) and assumes the request is legitimate.
- The bank transfers â‚¹1,00,000 from your account to the hackerâ€™s account.

---

### **What Does CSRF Protection Do?**

1. **Requires a CSRF Token**:
   - The bank includes a **CSRF token** in its webpages (e.g., in a hidden form field or a cookie).
   - Example token: `csrfToken=abcdef123456`.

2. **Validates the Token**:
   - When you (Aman) submit a request to transfer money, the CSRF token must be included in the request (e.g., in a header or body).

3. **Blocks Unauthorized Requests**:
   - When the hackerâ€™s malicious request is sent, it doesnâ€™t include the CSRF token (since the hacker doesnâ€™t have it).
   - The bank rejects the request because the CSRF token is missing or invalid.

---

### **How CSRF Protection Works (Step-by-Step)**

#### **1. Aman Logs Into HDFC Bank**
- After login, the bank generates a CSRF token (e.g., `csrfToken=abcdef123456`) and includes it in the webpage or a cookie.

#### **2. Aman Performs an Action**
- When you submit a form (e.g., to transfer money), the browser includes:
  - Your session cookie (`sessionId=123456`).
  - The CSRF token (`csrfToken=abcdef123456`).

#### **3. Bank Validates the Request**
- The bank checks:
  1. Is the session cookie valid? (Yes)
  2. Does the request include a valid CSRF token? (Yes)
- If both checks pass, the request is processed.

#### **4. Hackerâ€™s Request is Blocked**
- When the hackerâ€™s malicious request is sent:
  - It includes your session cookie (sent automatically by the browser).
  - **BUT it doesnâ€™t include the CSRF token**.
- The bank rejects the request because the CSRF token is missing or invalid.

---

### **Why CSRF Protection is Effective**
- CSRF tokens are unique and tied to a session, so:
  - Attackers cannot guess or forge them.
  - They cannot steal them because they are tied to secure cookies or sent explicitly in headers.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Without CSRF Protection**:
  - The hacker can trick you into making unintended actions (e.g., transferring money).
- **With CSRF Protection**:
  - The bank validates each request with a CSRF token, ensuring that only legitimate requests from the user are processed.
